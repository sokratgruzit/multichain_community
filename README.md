### Calling all blockchain enthusiasts!

CORE Multichain is building the future through blockchain technology and is looking to expand its team. We are looking for AI researchers, university professors, computer scientists, mathematicians, cryptographers, and data scientists to join our team.

We also offer a grant program for projects that will add value to the CORE Multichain ecosystem. Grants are available for the following project categories:
- Tools for development and deployment (e.g., IDEs and SDKs for side chains)
- Runtime Modules related to interoperability, governance, and consensus
- Ecosystem developers like wallets and exchanges.
- Monitoring, such as block explorers and off-chain data services
- Distributed file system developers
- Bridge integrators

Since CORE is centered around its community, we want the developer, science, and academic communities to join our efforts to help us enhance our ecosystem. Therefore, we encourage project proposals. These proposals can be related to any-blockchain related topics such as blockchain consensus protocols, smart contracts, sharding, etc. We are also interested in other fields such as AI, machine learning, game theory, cloud computing, and 5G.

If you are interested in joining the CORE Multichain team or have a project that you believe can add value to CORE Multichain and blockchain technology as a whole, then feel free to contact us.

:+1: We look forward to hearing from you! :smiling_face_with_three_hearts:
