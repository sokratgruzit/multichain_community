### Calling all blockchain enthusiasts!

CORE Multichain is building the future through blockchain technology and is looking to expand its team. We are looking for AI researchers, university professors, computer scientists, mathematicians, cryptographers, and data scientists to join our team.

We also offer a grant program for projects that will add value to the CORE Multichain ecosystem. Grants are available for the following project categories:
- Tools for development and deployment (e.g., IDEs and SDKs for side chains)
- Runtime Modules related to interoperability, governance, and consensus
- Ecosystem developers like wallets and exchanges.
- Monitoring, such as block explorers and off-chain data services
- Distributed file system developers
- Bridge integrators

Since CORE is centered around its community, we want the developer, science, and academic communities to join our efforts to help us enhance our ecosystem. Therefore, we encourage project proposals. These proposals can be related to any-blockchain related topics such as blockchain consensus protocols, smart contracts, sharding, etc. We are also interested in other fields such as AI, machine learning, game theory, cloud computing, and 5G.

If you are interested in joining the CORE Multichain team or have a project that you believe can add value to CORE Multichain and blockchain technology as a whole, then feel free to contact us.

:+1: We look forward to hearing from you! :smiling_face_with_three_hearts:

#### CORE Multichain is a blockchain movement that aims to solve scalability, interoperability, and throughput problems while increasing user privacy and usability.

We strive to make significant contributions towards Web3 technology by promoting innovation in the blockchain and digital currency space. In our efforts to maximize innovation in the blockchain technology and Web3 space, we are excited to announce that CORE Multichain will be hosting a hackathon! Developers from across the globe will be able to participate in this hackathon to create the next best innovation in blockchain technology.

Since blockchain technology is in its infancy, there is a lot of room for innovation. However, we are looking for developers that can innovate in the following aspects of blockchain and cryptocurrency technology:

* Consensus Protocols
* Smart Contracts
* Sharding
* Scalability
* Security and Privacy
* Data Analytics
* Artificial Intelligence
* Machine Learning
* Game Theory
* Cloud Computing
* Edge Computing
* 5G and Beyond

> Developers can either choose one of the aspects or touch on multiple aspects in their solution.

### Guidelines:

:zap:CORE Multichain lives by the belief that together, members and teams of the blockchain industry can grow in a collective effort to make significant contributions to the blockchain space. We support many teams and organizations within the blockchain community and receive requests to partner and/or sponsor many projects. Unfortunately, with the high volume of requests that we receive, we cannot participate and answer every request.:zap:

 :sparkles:To nurture and grow our blockchain community, we host annual events such as hackathons and offer a grant program to help exciting blockchain-related project proposals go from idea to reality. :sparkles:

:boom:Teams need to register and submit their project proposals to participate in our hackathon. We only allow project proposals that deal with the blockchain-related aspects listed in our hackathon announcement. Once approved, teams will be notified of the following steps by a member of the CORE Multichain team.:boom:

:anger:As mentioned, teams can also apply for grants. Teams need to send grant proposals to the CORE Multichain team like the hackathon application process. Only projects under the blockchain topics listed in our hackathon announcement will be considered. The grant process is also milestone-based. This ensures that projects who send these requests are serious about the process and about contributing to the blockchain space.:anger:

#### We recommend the following guidelines when writing a proposal for a grant or a project for the hackathon:

- List which blockchain-related aspect your hackathon project or grant project will fall under.
    For more information, you can refer to the hackathon announcement to see which blockchain-related aspects are supported by the CORE Multichain team. Your project can fall under more than one of the supported blockchain aspects.

- Focus your proposal around what problem in the blockchain space your project addresses.

- Discuss how your project can contribute to the CORE Multichain ecosystem.

- Introduce your team.

### Code of Conduct:

> This event is a community hackathon to promote collaboration, innovation, and learning in the CORE Multichain and broader blockchain communities. We encourage and value the participation of each member of the community and want each member and team that participates in our hackathon to have an enjoyable experience. Therefore, all participants are expected to show respect and courtesy towards all other participants in the hackathon. All participants are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct which organizers will enforce throughout the event.

#### The Code

The Code intends to prohibit activities including but not limited to:
